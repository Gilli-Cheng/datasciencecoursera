# Objects
create any vector by `vector()`
list can include 
explicity wants a integer suffix L 1(num) 1L(int)
`attributes()` can modify names, dimensions, class, length etc.
`c()` is a func to be used to create vectors of objects
finally , by using `vector()` "datatype", length=..
you can set the vector as you wanted
then uses `class(x)` to know the datatype currently 

```{r}
x<- c(0.5, 0.6)     ## numeric 
x<- c(TRUE, FALSE)  ## logical
x<- c(T, F)         ## logical
x<- c("a","b","c")  ## charac
x<- 9:29            ## integer
x<- c(1+0i, 2+3i)   ## complex

x <- vector("numeric", length =10)
x
class(x)
```

# mixed objects
```{r}
y <- c(2,"y") ## character
y
y <- c(TRUE, 3) ## numeric
y
y <- c("a", TRUE) ## character
y
```

# using as.datatype(x)

```{r}
x <- 0:8
x
class(x)
as.logical(x)
as.numeric(x)
as.character(x)
as.complex(x)
```


```{r}
b <- c("1","2","3")
class(b)
as.logical(b)
as.numeric(b)
```

# lists
```{r}
x <- list( TRUE, 2+3i, "g", 3)
x
```









```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
